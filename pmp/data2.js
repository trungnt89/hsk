    "question": "The night before a standup meeting, a project manager realizes that they will be unable to attend the daily standup meeting in person but will join via phone. The project manager sent an email to the project team letting them know. One of the team members is upset that, despite having the longest commute, they are expected to attend the meeting in person.\nHow should the project manager address this situation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amend the current attendance policy to allow all team members to attend standup meetings remotely.",
      "B": "Rotate the location of the standup meetings to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to attend in person.",
      "C": "Review the guidelines for meeting attendance including when remote attendance is allowed and under what circumstances.",
      "D": "Communicate the reasons for attending standup meetings in person and the benefits of doing so."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Review the guidelines for meeting attendance including when remote attendance is allowed and under what circumstances.\nBy reviewing guidelines and expectations, the project manager can address the team member's concerns and ensure that everyone feels valued and included in the project. This will help ensure that everyone is aware of the expectations and guidelines for attending meetings, and can help prevent misunderstandings or hurt feelings.\nThe other options are incorrect.\nAmending the attendance policy to allow all team members to attend standup meetings remotely or rotating the location of meetings may not be feasible or practical, and may not address the underlying issue.\nCommunicating the reasons for attending standup meetings in person may help team members understand the importance of attending in person but it should be done by reviewing meeting guidelines and expectations."
